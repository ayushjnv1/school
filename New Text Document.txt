Isolated I/O
Isolated I/O uses separate memory space.
Limited instructions can be used. Those are IN, OUT, INS, OUTS.
The addresses for Isolated I/O devices are called ports.
IORC & IOWC signals expands the circuitry.
Efficient I/O operations due to using separate bus
Comparatively larger in size
Uses complex internal logic
Slower operations


Memory Mapped I/O
Memory mapped I/O uses memory from the main memory.
Any instruction which references to memory can be used.
Memory mapped I/O devices are treated as memory locations on the memory map.
IORC & IOWC signals has no functions in this case which reduces the circuitry.
Inefficient I/O operations due to using single bus for data and addressing
Smaller in size
Common internal logic for memory and I/O devices
Faster operations


Advantages:

Isolated I/O:

• All I/O locations are addressed in exactly the same manner as memory locations. Thus the overall size of the instruction is reduced.

• All arithmetic and logical operators are performed.

• Memory requirement is small .

Memory Mapped I/O:

• Large memory address spaces are available to use.

• Special instructions for I/O operations maximize the performance.


Disadvantages

Isolated I/O:

• Part of the memory address space is lost.

Memory Mapped I/O:

• Data has to be transferred to the accumulator to perform arithmetic and logic operations.
